Iteration cutoff and largest community cutoff produce similar results.

Refusing to merge into mega-communities produces many similarly sized
communities.

The seed selection algorithms prefer to
have access to entire network, under iteration and largest community cutoffs.

Rotation through similarly sized communities performs well, even for moderately
sized communities.

Random choice in similarly sized communities performs better on moderately
sized communities than choosing the largest community.

Choosing largest community prefers to have large communities for all
seed selection algorithms.
